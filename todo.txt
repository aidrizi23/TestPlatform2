TODO: Time Zone Issue Documentation and Solutions

## ISSUE: Time Zone Difference
The application currently has a time zone inconsistency issue. Here's what's happening:

### Problem:
1. All DateTime values are stored in UTC using DateTime.UtcNow in the backend
2. When displaying dates to users, the application shows UTC times without conversion
3. Users see times that don't match their local time zone

### Where the issue occurs:
- Test creation dates (Test.CreatedAt)
- Test scheduling dates (ScheduledStartDate, ScheduledEndDate) 
- Test attempt times (StartTime, EndTime)
- Invite sent dates (InviteSentDate)
- Archive dates (ArchivedAt)

### Current code examples showing the issue:
- In Views/Test/Details.cshtml line 233: @Model.ScheduledStartDate.Value.ToString("MMM dd, yyyy 'at' HH:mm")
- In Views/Test/Index.cshtml line 347: @test.ScheduledStartDate.Value.ToString("MMM dd, HH:mm")
- In Controllers: DateTime.UtcNow is used everywhere for storing times

### SOLUTIONS (in order of recommendation):

## Solution 1: Client-side conversion (RECOMMENDED)
- Keep storing UTC in database (good practice)
- Convert UTC to local time in JavaScript on the client side
- Use JavaScript's Date.toLocaleString() or similar methods
- This automatically handles user's browser time zone

## Solution 2: Server-side conversion with user preference
- Add TimeZone field to User model
- Convert UTC to user's preferred timezone on server before sending to view
- Requires user to set their timezone preference

## Solution 3: Display UTC with clear indication
- Continue showing UTC times but add "(UTC)" suffix
- Simple but not user-friendly for global users

## Solution 4: Mixed approach
- Use client-side conversion for most dates
- Keep UTC for scheduled dates with clear timezone indication
- Best user experience but requires more implementation work

### Technical Implementation Notes:
- Database storage is correct (UTC) - don't change this
- Frontend JavaScript can handle timezone conversion automatically
- Consider using data attributes to pass UTC timestamps to JavaScript
- Use Intl.DateTimeFormat for proper internationalization
