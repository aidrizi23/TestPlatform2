// 14. Implement accessibility features (screen reader support, high contrast) (do not do)








make the show archived test filter be ajax and also include it in other filters.
also keep in mind to make the methods to add the questions (in the test details view so that they will be ajax only) and also keep in mind to add the ajax question endpoint to the question controller to create each type of question with ajax.
also keep in mind that i want you to redesign the take test view so that it will support the new types of quesitons. 
i would also like you to add another type of question. the one where the user can choose in a table form. and also remove the picture question. 
add the ability to add images to questions and save the images in the wwwroot folder based on the user and the question id. 
also remove everything for the image based question. and also make sure to make the taketest view support all types of questions.
