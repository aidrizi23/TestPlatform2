    Invite Students:

        A professor adds student emails to TestInvite.

        Emails are sent with a unique link: https://yourapp.com/test/{testId}?token={UniqueToken}.

    Start Test:

        Students click the link and enter their name/email (no login).

        The system validates the token and creates a TestAttempt.

    Track Activity:

        IsUsed in TestInvite marks if a student started the test.

        TestAttempt records timestamps and whether they finished (IsCompleted).
