# TestPlatform Todo List
# Comprehensive analysis of tasks needed for production-ready platform
# Generated: 2025-06-14

## CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (High Priority - Do First!)
☐ Add CSRF protection to all forms and state-changing actions
☐ Implement comprehensive input validation with proper attributes
☐ Move sensitive data (DB passwords, SMTP, Stripe keys) to User Secrets/Environment Variables
☐ Add proper role-based access control and resource authorization
☐ Implement rate limiting for API endpoints and critical actions
☐ Add proper HTTP method attributes ([HttpPost], [HttpGet], etc.) to controller actions

## CORE MISSING FEATURES (High Priority)
☐ Complete Stripe subscription system with billing logic
☐ Build REST API endpoints for mobile/SPA integration
☐ Fix and test email verification flow completely
☐ Complete password reset functionality in controllers
☐ Add proper error handling and user feedback for all operations

## IMPORTANT PLATFORM FEATURES (Medium Priority)
☐ Implement bulk operations (invite sending, question import/export, test management)
☐ Create question bank system for reusable question libraries
☐ Build advanced analytics dashboard with detailed performance metrics
☐ Implement file upload system for questions (images, audio, video)
☐ Create test templates for common test types
☐ Add proctoring features (anti-cheating, monitoring, time tracking)
☐ Build automated notification system for test events
☐ Implement gradebook functionality with grade management and export

## TESTING & QUALITY ASSURANCE (Medium Priority)
☐ Create comprehensive unit test project
☐ Add integration tests for critical workflows
☐ Optimize database queries and add proper indexing
☐ Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
☐ Enhance logging with structured logging and monitoring
☐ Set up automated backup and recovery procedures

## USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS (Low Priority)
☐ Optimize UI for mobile devices and tablets
☐ Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
☐ Implement dark mode theme option
☐ Add search functionality across tests, questions, and results
☐ Expand export formats (CSV, Excel, Word, JSON)
☐ Add more question types (drag-drop, matching, essay with auto-grading)

## ADVANCED FEATURES (Low Priority)
☐ Build collaborative features for multi-teacher environments
☐ Create comprehensive student dashboard with progress tracking
☐ Develop parent portal for accessing student results
☐ Add LMS integration (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle)
☐ Plan and develop mobile applications

## DEVOPS & INFRASTRUCTURE (Low Priority)
☐ Optimize Docker setup for production deployment
☐ Set up CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
☐ Create comprehensive API documentation
☐ Add internationalization support for multiple languages
☐ Set up monitoring and alerting for production environment

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS NOTES:
✅ Clean UI design with consistent blue/white theme
✅ Functional test creation, editing, and taking workflow
✅ Profile settings pages with proper form handling
✅ Email service with proper error handling
✅ Basic export functionality (PDF)
✅ Test scheduling with background service
✅ Repository pattern implementation
✅ Bootstrap-based responsive design

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Recommended Order):
1. Fix security issues (CSRF, validation, secrets management)
2. Add HTTP method attributes and proper error handling
3. Complete subscription system since Stripe is already configured
4. Implement unit testing framework
5. Add missing bulk operations
6. Build question bank system

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
- Project has solid architecture foundation
- Email and export services are well-implemented
- Image service exists but needs file upload integration
- Background services are properly configured
- Database models use good EF Core patterns
- Code follows clean architecture principles
